# CyclicAgent
CyclicAgent is a framework designed for creating fully autonomous, self-prompting agents that operate continuously, 24/7.

## How does CyclicAgent work?
CyclicAgent is built on the concept of state cycling. In this framework, an agent is invoked with an existing state, performs its designated operations, and then outputs a new state.

## How is CyclicAgent different from other frameworks?
Unlike other agent frameworks such as LangChain or AutoGPT, which are event-driven and task-oriented, CyclicAgent is time-driven. Agents in this framework are not designed to complete a specific task and then stop; instead, they are engineered to take actions at regular time intervals and to run indefinitely.
